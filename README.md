# Asssrrro Runner

**Asssrrro Runner** is an exciting 2D space-themed game built using Python Pygame. This is my first time using Python to code a game. This 5-day project to learn and create something using Python and the pygame library.

## How to play?
Dodge the asteroids using your mouse and collect the blue stars to gain score. As time goes on the asteroids will gain speed making it harder!
